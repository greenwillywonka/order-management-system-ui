I decided to build an ERP/Order Management System. I wanted to build something that I thought would be useful to small companies and people to track any purchase orders that come their way.

I had the inspiration for this app when I worked at my last company. I was brought in to help adjust and aclimate the company to a new ERP system. A lot of the system was overkill for our usecase and it made it confusing at times. As a developer, I wanted to recreate a simple dashboard so I could track any orders I created. This would let the user know when the order was placed, when the order was requested to be recieved, what stage the order is in (pending, shipped, complete) as well as what was purchased and how much the total price is. 

I saw the value of these kinds of systems - especially when they are tailormade for a sepcific, pre-defined process. That is when I decided to build the Basic Order Management System. I do believe there is no limit to how involved and how connected this system can be. 

For my UI I used React as the front end and had Vite scaffold out the integral pieces for me. 
I used Clerk for authentification. I used Tailwind and ChatGTP to help me with the sytling. I used FastAPI and SupaBase for my backend. All of my backend was written in python while my frontend was written mostly in JSX with some CSS for the styling. I used minimal HTML for this project.
